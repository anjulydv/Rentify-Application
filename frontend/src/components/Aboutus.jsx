              After successfully consolidating its position as a customer-first brand,
              known for its reliability and transparency, MakeMyTrip launched its India
              operations in 2005.
              <br />
              <br />
              As low-cost flight carriers were introduced in India, the number of
              Indians opting for online travel solutions also increased rapidly. And
              MakeMyTrip answered the call of the hour, by bringing the convenience of
              booking flights, hotels, and holiday packages in just a few clicks.
              <br />
              <br />
              Over the years, we have partnered with many leading brands from the
              aviation &amp; hospitality industries, creating fruitful partner relations
              for business expansion opportunities. We also entered the{" "}
              <span className="latoBold">homestays &amp; villas</span> and continue to
              procure increased market share market in the same. With this, we also
              entered the ground transport space and commenced offering cab, bus &amp;
              train booking services.
              <br />
              <br />
              What makes our story even stronger is the performance of our newly
              launched segments, like
              <span>myBiz</span>—our comprehensive business travel suite and
              myPartner—an exclusive platform for travel agents. Entering the Gulf
